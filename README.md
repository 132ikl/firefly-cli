# Commands
The scope of this CLI is to enter expenses in CSV style. Therefore, some commands do not have a "very polished" UI for the moment. I am looking forward to improve this soon!

If you find any bugs (which you WILL!), please submit a new issue or PR! I am more than happy to accept new suggestions, improvements and corrections.

A summary of the available commands is the following:

## `add`
This command is responsible for entering a new expense in your Firefly instance.
The fields available are: 

| Amount | Description | Source account | Destination account | Category | Budget |
|:------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:-------------------:|:--------:|:------:|

The first three fields can't be omitted.

**Examples:**
- A simple one:

  - `üê∑ ‚ûú add 5, Large Mocha, Cash`

- One with all the fields being used:
 
  - `üê∑ ‚ûú add 5, Large Mocha, Cash, Starbucks, Coffee Category, Food Budget`

- You can skip specfic fields by leaving them empty (except the first two):
  - `üê∑ ‚ûú add 5, Large Mocha, Cash, , , UCO Bank`
